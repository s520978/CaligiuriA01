		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I am from Omaha Nebraska. Born and raised into a Husker family. One of my favorite hobbies is to play and watch basketball. I decided to go to Northwest with some of my friends from high school. I originally was a Computer Science major but switched to Interactive Digital Media.</p>

		<h2>Future work plans</h2>
		<p>I honestly haven't really thought about it yet. I know I can do a lot of different things once I get my degree, but I haven't truly decided yet. I would say web design is probably my favorite thing about my major so working for a big company on their website would be really cool. I also have an internship lined up for next summer. </p>
		
		<h2>Current Schedule</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Intro to Design</li>
			<li>Media Design</li>
			<li>Web Apps</li>
			<li>Visualization</li>
		</ul>
